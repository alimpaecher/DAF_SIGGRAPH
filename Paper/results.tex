\section{Results}
\subsection{Before and After}
I suppose this is where we show some before and afters of people's drawings before hand, and people's drawings afterwards.

This could either be User Studies, or we could take existing drawings and run them through the algorithm, playing them back.This would probably work. However users don't get the feedback of their strokes changing, which would be really useful.

\subsection{Unscientific User Studies}
This could be one and the same with the Before and After. But there may be a benefit from walking around and giving people the auto correcting app to play with.

\caption{DrawAFriend users draw one of six celebrities (a). We use our database of hundreds of drawings per subject -- shown averaged in (b) -- to precompute a \emph{correction vector field} (c) enabling real-time drawing assistance on the iPhone. The magnitude of our vector field (d) reveals a consensus of artistic renderings strikingly different than what we could compute with automated methods, such as a canny edge detector (e).}
