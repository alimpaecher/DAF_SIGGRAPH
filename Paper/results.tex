\section{Results}
\subsection{Before and After}
I suppose this is where we show some before and afters of people's drawings before hand, and people's drawings afterwards.

This could either be User Studies, or we could take existing drawings and run them through the algorithm, playing them back.This would probably work. However users don't get the feedback of their strokes changing, which would be really useful.

\subsection{Unscientific User Studies}
This could be one and the same with the Before and After. But there may be a benefit from walking around and giving people the auto correcting app to play with.
