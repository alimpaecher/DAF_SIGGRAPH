We have developed DrawAFriend, a Facebook-integrated turn-based drawing and guessing game for mobile devices.  It works as follows. Players have an option to start a game with either a Facebook friend or a random other player.  The player is then given four pictures which he can draw. These will either be mutual Facebook friends' profile pictures or in the case of a random player, celebrity photos.

After choosing a photo to draw, the player is brought to the drawing screen. There she can trace the image (Figure~\ref{fig:DaF} left). At any point the user can press the {\em eye} button to hide the photo and see their drawing on its own (Figure~\ref{fig:DaF} right). To overcome the limitations of the phone's size, and touch screen inaccuracies, players can zoom using the pinch zoom gesture.
Once finished, the player sends her drawing to the friend or random player with whom she is playing. The friend will receive a notification that they have a drawing to guess. Once the drawing is complete, the user is prompted to guess the identity of another player's drawing (Figure~\ref{fig:DaF2} left). The user sees a replay of the drawing being made, and similar to hangman, the player can guess which letters are in the mutual friend or celebrity's name. Once all the consonants are guessed the final vowels are offered to complete the guess (Figure~\ref{fig:DaF2} right).

This tracing paradigm results in a set of pre-aligned drawings. Whereas other papers look at rasterized versions of drawings, we collect individual strokes represented as polylines along with timing information.  Furthermore, by observing the guesses we can indirectly evaluate the quality of the drawings. We hypothesize that a good drawing is much more likely to be guessed correctly than a bad drawing. DrawAFriend thus converts a dataset of quality photos, (Faceboook profile pictures) and celebrity images into a large dataset of user created drawings. This dataset will include drawings from artists around the world with different artistic and cultural backgrounds.

For the purposes of tackling the fat finger problem, we focus on the corpus of celebrity drawings, since we have a large number of drawings of the same photographs by many different artists. That said, not all drawings are created equal. While we did not want to pass judgment on different styles, certain drawings appear to be random scribbles by people simply trying out the game. We manually removed these from our database, resulting in an average of 100 usable drawings per celebrity.
