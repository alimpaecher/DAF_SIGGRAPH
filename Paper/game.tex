\section{DrawAFriend: The Game}

DrawAFriend is an asynchronous turn based guessing game. It works as follows. First a player will pick one of his/her facebook friends to play with. He is then given four mutual friends profile pictures which he can choose to draw. 

After choosing one of their mutual friends to draw, the player is brought to the drawing screen. There he/she can trace the image. At any point the user can press the “eye” button to hide the profile picture and just see their drawing.  Since the iPhone screen is quite small, and the touch screen is not that accurate, players can zoom using the pinch zoom gesture. 
Once finished, the player can send his/her drawing to the friend whom he is playing the game with. The friend will receive a notification that they have a drawing to guess. Similar to hangman, the player can guess which letters are in the mutual friends’ name. In order to guess a vowel, players must spend coins. Once all consonants have been guessed players can then buy vowels for free. 

This final process gives us a weak classifier of how good the images are. In general, a good drawing is much more likely to be guessed correctly than a bad drawing.
