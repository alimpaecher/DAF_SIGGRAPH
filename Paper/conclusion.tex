\section{Conclusion}

\begin{itemize}
\item interesting properties: everything we listed in the intro
\item interesting properties: humans can determine which transitions are good
\item this works for much more than just cloth
\item in the future, we'd like to apply this to continuous domain
\end{itemize}
  
\textbf{one thing that would make this paper much stronger is a
  theoretical exposition of how big we expect the space to grow with
  respect to several variables...}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{damping coef. on cloth }
\item \textbf{\# of clips in the motion graph}
\end{itemize}
\textbf{I'm concerned that none of our examples will have bifurcations in them}
