\section{Conclusion}

DrawAFriend
a successful new iPhone game we developed specifically for the
purpose of collecting drawing data.

One idea for bigger picture: Is that we have developed a format of dealing with the ``fat finger'' problem. A data-driven method to deal with that issue. (Though this might be more appropriate for an HCI project)

Looking further into the future, we hope that DrawAFriend will establish a template for Facebook applications that incentivizes the creation of large complex datasets. This will create a virtuous cycle between user interfaces, social experiences, and research to promote our understanding of our humanity in this ever evolving interconnected world.
