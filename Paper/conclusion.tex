\section{Conclusion}

DrawAFriend
a successful new iPhone game we developed specifically for the
purpose of collecting drawing data.

One idea for bigger picture: Is that we have developed a format of dealing with the ``fat finger'' problem. A data-driven method to deal with that issue. (Though this might be more appropriate for an HCI project)

Looking further into the future, we hope that DrawAFriend will establish a template for Facebook applications that incentivizes the creation of large complex datasets. This will create a virtuous cycle between user interfaces, social experiences, and research to promote our understanding of our humanity in this ever evolving interconnected world.

First, we assemble a corpus of aligned
drawings via a new iPhone game we developed specifically for the
purpose of collecting drawing data. Second, by analyzing the
database of drawings, we build a spatially varying model of artistic
consensus at the stroke level. Using this model, we introduce a
surprisingly simple method to improve strokes in real-time.
Importantly, our corrections appear nearly invisible to the user,
seamlessly preserving artistic intent while simplifying touch-based
drawing.
