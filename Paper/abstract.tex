Touch-screen interfaces have inspired a new generation of drawing
applications. However, inaccurate touch localization -- the ``fat
finger'' problem -- remains a principal challenge for such
direct-manipulation interfaces. We address this problem by analyzing
a large database of hand-drawn images generated by
\emph{DrawAFriend} a successful new iPhone game we developed
specifically for the purpose of collecting drawing data. We
integrate information from thousands of images using a new metric
for \emph{local stroke coherence} where many artists draw similar
strokes. Using this metric, we introduce a surprisingly simple
method to correct strokes in real-time. Importantly, our corrections
appear nearly invisible to the user, seamlessly preserving artistic
intent while simplifying touch-based drawing.
