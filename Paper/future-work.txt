results:

	- how many drawings did we get
	- how long did people take to draw them
	
	- total number of man-hours devoted playing your game
	
	- average # of strokes
	- average length of strokes
	- average length of guessing
	- percent correct and incorrect
	- short paragraph 

	- Teaser Reported 4 more times
		4 different celebrities
		Before and after
		2 pairs of before and after
		Same way as the teaser
		
		
weaknesses: 

- even with our enhancements, the drawings are not beautiful
	- FW: aesthetic enhancements, what the stroke looks like

- we don't anything interesting about intersection
	- lifting the thing into 3D
	- but in fact it works really well in practice

- single consensus model: works for certain dominant lines / not for
	"style" or texture / based on what you're drawing
	identifying the artist

- we can't correct your strokes
	- 
	
- we want to learn a lot more from these drawings
	- how to people draw eyes
	- what order do they draw strokes
	- what will they draw next?


- things that the game tells that we're not yet exploiting
	- how 
	- where they zoom
	- which strokes do they undo?
		- could that be a clue as to which strokes are good or bad
	- whether they guessed quickly and how long
		- use this as weights for the consensus.
		- which were most salient for recognition

- future work

	- user testing: do people notice that their strokes are being modified. 
	- user test on the player population / measure how long it takes them to draw images
