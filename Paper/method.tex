\section{Secondary Motion Graphs}

Like de Aguilar et al.~\shortcite{deAguiar:2010}, we are interested in capturing the dynamics of cloth motion induced by a character moving within a finite motion graph.


\subsection{Definition}

\begin{itemize}
\item for each primary state we have one or more secondary state
\item for each primary transition, we have one secondary transition
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Endless Exploration}

\begin{itemize}
\item goal: minimize (in some sense) the physics error
\item goal: to have in principle a working graph at each point in time
\item goal: emphasize that this can be done endlessly, with PCA computed as we go along.
\item depth first search simulation
\item post processing:blending + PCA
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Dynamical Bifurcations and Convergence}

\begin{itemize}
\item expected convergence
\item detecting bifurcations
\end{itemize}
