\subsection{Auto-magically Correcting Lines}
Using least squares method in order to move lines towards average while keeping the general shape.

We'll have some amazing vector flow showing in what direction lines want to be pulled if at all.

Live demo on the iPhone.

Method:
Have a vector field that calculate the nearest neighbor location of the the current stroke.
Use least squares to preserve curvature but still map to current stroke.
We have a weighting for how to balance location and curvature. Wonder if we should expose this to the user in some way?

\subsection{Calculating Agreement}
The linear correlation of nearest neighbors when strokes in an area are in agreement.

\subsection{Auto-Extending Lines}
We don't have anything doing this.

\subsection{Preserving Style}
Adaboosting but for strokes. We haven't really done this yet.
